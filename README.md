#NLP_with_dissaster_tweets



Objective:

Predict whether a question asked is sincere or not. This is a kernels only competition.

Has an exaggerated tone to underscore a point about a group of people
Is rhetorical and meant to imply a statement about a group of people
Is disparaging or inflammatory
Suggests a discriminatory idea against a protected class of people, or seeks confirmation of a stereotype
Makes disparaging attacks/insults against a specific person or group of people
Based on an outlandish premise about a group of people
Disparages against a characteristic that is not fixable and not measurable
Isn't grounded in reality
Based on false information, or contains absurd assumptions
Uses sexual content (incest, bestiality, pedophilia) for shock value, and not to seek genuine answers
P.S: This is a work in progress. Please stay tuned.!
